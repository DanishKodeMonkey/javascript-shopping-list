# Javascript Shopping list

## A minimalist javascript shopping list

### Description

In an effort to put practise into DOM manipulation using javascript
I made this simple shopping list application using various methods and techniques I have learned during the [The Odin Project, DOM manipulation](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-dom-manipulation-and-events) curriculum.

### The process

During the exercise, I am granted a basic html starting point with minimal CSS added to it featuring a div, label, input, button, and an empty list. Ass well as a script element. All additions to the exercise is made inside the script.

#### Note: While aware that a separated JS/CSS reference solution would be best. For the purpose of the exercise, this is all done in the html.
